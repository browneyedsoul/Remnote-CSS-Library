# Remacs Vertico

Inspired by an Emacs plugin named [vertico.el](https://github.com/minad/vertico)

## Purpose

Sometimes, itâ€™s difficult to find specific items because there are too many results, and breadcrumbs get mixed in, making the list cluttered. Also, the search result pane has limited height, restricting the number of visible results. To address these issues, I decided to add a configuration option to simplify and clean up the search results.

This feature would be especially useful if you need to search for

- Specific Command Lines (Document rems) quickly.
- Specific Terms (Document rems) quickly
- Specific Document rems quickly

## Limitation

Currently, it only displays document rems. This is 100% intentional to ensure quick searching for specific document rems, and this behavior will never be changed.
